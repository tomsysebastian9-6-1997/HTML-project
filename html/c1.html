	<h1><font color="red">Generation of computer</font></h1>
	<p><font color="green">Computer generations are based on when major technological changes in computers occurred, like the use of vacuum tubes, transistors, and the microprocessor. As of <del>2017</del> <ins>2018</ins>, there are five generations of the computer.</font></p>
	<dl>
	<dt><h2><font color="red">1<sup>st</sup> Generation</font></h2></dt>
	<dd>
	<p>The first generation of computers used vacuum tubes as a major piece of technology. Vacuum tubes were widely used in computers from 1940 through 1956. Vacuum tubes were larger components and resulted in first generation computers being quite large in size, taking up a lot of space in a room. Some of the first generation computers took up an entire room.</br>The ENIAC is a great example of a first generation computer.<a href="https://www.google.com"><b><em>Google</em></b></a>
	 It consisted of nearly 20,000 vacuum tubes, as well as 10,000 capacitors and 70,000 resistors. It weighed over 30 tons and took up a lot of space, requiring a large room to house it. Other examples of first generation computers include the EDSAC, IBM 701, and Manchester Mark 1.</p><hr/></dd>
	<dt><h3>Second Generation</h3></dt> 
	<dd>
	<p>The second generation of computers saw the use of transistors instead of vacuum tubes. Transistors were widely used in computers from 1956 to 1963. Transistors were smaller than vacuum tubes and allowed computers to be smaller in size, faster in speed, and cheaper to build.<a href="https://www.youtube.com"><b><em>Youtube</em></b></a>The second generation of computers saw the use of transistors instead of vacuum tubes.

	<h4>Third Generation</h4>
	<p>The third generation of computers introduced the use of IC (integrated circuits) in computers. Using IC's in computers helped reduce the size of computers even more compared to second-generation computers, as well as make them faster.</p><hr/>
	<h5>Fourth Generation</h5>
	<p>The fourth generation of computers took advantage of the invention of the <a href="https://www.computerhope.com/jargon/c/cpu.htm"><b><em>microprocessor</em></b></a>, more commonly known as a CPU. Microprocessors, along with integrated circuits, helped make it possible for computers to fit easily on a desk and for the introduction of the laptop.</br>H<sub>2</sub>O</p>
